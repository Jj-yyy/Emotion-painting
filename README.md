# Emotion Painting

By choosing one of four emotional images — Happy, Sad, Angry, or Calm — users can draw on the canvas, and each emotion generates a unique visual effect:

- Happy: Bright yellow bubbles float upward, full of vitality
- Sad: Blue teardrops fall slowly with gradient effects
- Angry: Fiery red sparks explode and scatter intensely
- Calm: Gentle green-blue ripples expand outward peacefully

## Interaction Design
- User Input: Mouse click and drag
